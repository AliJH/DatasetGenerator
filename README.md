# Python Dataset Generator
Plan is to have a suite of Jupyter Notebooks that take user input to define general properties of a dataset which can then be dynamically generated.

Came about as I wanted to try and make an org chart visual in Power BI but I couldn't find any open source HR datasets that felt like they were reasonable fits for this purpose. Initially took the form of a monolithic Python script to mash together names, teams and job titles which worked but I got distracted by improving and genericising this process and haven't actually started on the Power BI side yet.

Using Python/Jupyter Notebooks as I haven't had a chance to use these tools professionally yet so I figured I should start teaching myself.

Hopefully once things are a little mature they might be useful for others as well. While contrived data is never going to match real world data for messiness and frustrations I'm hopeful that these datasets will get a little closer than others I have come across and might be useful learning tools for folks getting started with data visualisation and analysis.
